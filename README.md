# Module 5 Challenge - WOrk Day Scheduler Submission 

This is my submission for the Module 5 challenge. 

Upon opening the page, you will be shown a color coded schedule for a 8 AM to 5 PM work day. There is a text box for every hour of the day where you can type the tasks you need to complete within the day. You will see a red textbox for the present hour, and everything in the future will be green and everything in the past will be in grey. Once the task is typed out make sure to click the save button since once it is clicked you will be able to leave or refresh the page, and your input will still be there!
